This is a fun project I created out of the necessity to have to constantly update my Atom settings folder.
I now know that there's easier ways to do this but since I had already started this project I decided to finish it
especially since I needed the Python experience.

What this will do is keep an exact copy of a directory in a different directory which sounds initally
useless but it was interesting to do regardless.
